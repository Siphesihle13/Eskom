# Eskom

As a last resort, load shedding occurs when customer-demands for electricity exceeds the supply available from coal-fired generators which - if aren't controlled in this manner - may 
yield the consequence of a total collapse of the national powergrid. Therefore we would further like to create a model that can predict whether the country 
might experience more outages in future based on forecasted and actual available electricity from Eskom using aforementioned datafrom the last 6 years(2017-2020).
